Thanks to the creators of:
- zcmd

## Description:

This Filterscript is capable of logging:

- Death (playerid,killerid,reason)

- Commands
- Enter/Exit Vehicle
- PlayerTake/DealDamage
- Interior Change(Oldinterior, NewInterior)
- Connect/Disconnect(name,Ip,reason);

## Installation:

1. Download the package
2. insert sscanf and the Directory plugin into your server.cfg `plugin sscanf Directory`
3. insert Log into your server.cfg `filterscripts Log`
4. Start your server

If any errors occur, just ask me for help.

## Configuration:

You can change the configuration per config file which is "Logs\config.cfg" or per /logmenu (Dialog).
Single Commands for all settings are in developement (I am a bit lazy that's why it is still not done).

## Bugs , Requests and Ideas:

If you find any bugs, have ideas for improvment or new features, post them here: [GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/Bios-Marcel/SA-MP_Log/issues).

## Problems:

Might cause performance problems on bigger servers depending on the settings that you chose.

## Future Plans:

- Better Documentation
- Functionallity to read logs ingame
- Control everything per commands

## Version:
1.3.3.4

greetings Marcel
